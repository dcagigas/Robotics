This directory/folder contains the Python scripts that predict the inverse kinematic of the Scorbot ER VII robot. Four cases are proposed:

1) Scorbot_ANN_bootstrapping_and Classical_approach: here the classical approach using one MLP-ANN (Multimultilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network). The tuning process is also included using Keras tuner. The tuning proccess here is the final result of other test not included here: two layers, scaled inputs, etc. 

2) Scorbot_ANN_bootstrapping_96

3) Scorbot_ANN_sub-working-area_spaces_96

4) Scorbot_ANN_hybrid_bootstrapping-swas_54+54
